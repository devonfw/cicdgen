# CICDGEN

cicdgen is a devonfw tool for generate all code/files related to CICD. It's based on [angular schematics](https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2), so you can add it as a dependency into your project and generate the code using ng generate. As it is not only related to angular projects, we also provide a CLI for generate files in non-angular projects. The CLI is in a separated package.
